  - What are important Java EE Design Patterns? https://github.com/in28minutes/Java-EE-Design-Patterns
- Some Creational patterns Examples
  - Factory method
    - java.util.Calendar#getInstance() & java.nio.charset.Charset#forName()
  - Prototype
    - java.lang.Object#clone()
  - Singleton
    - java.lang.Runtime#getRuntime() & java.lang.System#getSecurityManager()
- Some Structural patterns
  - Adapter
    - java.util.Arrays#asList() & javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.XmlAdapter#marshal() and #unmarshal()
  - Decorator
    - All subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream etc. & java.util.Collections : synchronizedXXX() and unmodifiableXXX() methods.
  - Flyweight
    - java.lang.Integer#valueOf(int) (also on other Wrapper classes)
- Behavioral patterns
  - Chain of responsibility
    - javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter() & Exception Handling
  - Command
    - java.lang.Runnable
  - Iterator
    - All implementations of java.util.Iterator
  - Strategy (recognizeable by behavioral methods in an abstract/interface type which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type which has been passed-in as method argument into the strategy implementation)
    - java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().
  - Template method (recognizeable by behavioral methods which already have a "default" behaviour definied by an abstract type)
    - All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.
